# Logic Project: Equivalency and Implication

- Summary:
Enter two formulas in each specified section and press "Submit" button to see the results obtained from them.

- Caution:
Formulas with more than 15 unique atoms may cause the program to slow down dramatically or crash. (NP complexity)

- Usage:
Use [A-Z][a-z] letters for Atom indication - exception: letter "v" is dedicated for OR symbol - and use the symbols from list below to create formulas.
Press "Submit" when both formulas were entered.

- Symbols:
"~" : NOT
"v" : OR
"^" : AND
"->" : IMPLY
"<->" : XNOR

- Example:
f1: "A -> B", f2: "~A v B", (Submit), (Result: Equivalent and Implies)
